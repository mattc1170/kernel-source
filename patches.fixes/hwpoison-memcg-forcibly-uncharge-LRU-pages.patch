Subject: [PATCH] hwpoison, memcg: forcibly uncharge LRU pages
Git-commit: 18365225f0440d09708ad9daade2ec11275c3df9
Patch-mainline: 4.12-rc1
References: bnc#1046105

Laurent Dufour has noticed that hwpoinsoned pages are kept charged.  In
his particular case he has hit a bad_page("page still charged to
cgroup") when onlining a hwpoison page.  While this looks like something
that shouldn't happen in the first place because onlining hwpages and
returning them to the page allocator makes only little sense it shows a
real problem.

hwpoison pages do not get freed usually so we do not uncharge them (at
least not since commit 0a31bc97c80c ("mm: memcontrol: rewrite uncharge
API")).  Each charge pins memcg (since e8ea14cc6ead ("mm: memcontrol:
take a css reference for each charged page")) as well and so the
mem_cgroup and the associated state will never go away.  Fix this leak
by forcibly uncharging a LRU hwpoisoned page in delete_from_lru_cache().
We also have to tweak uncharge_list because it cannot rely on zero ref
count for these pages.
