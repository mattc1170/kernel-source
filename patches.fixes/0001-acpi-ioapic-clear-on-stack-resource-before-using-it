Subject: ACPI, ioapic: Clear on-stack resource before using it
Patch-mainline: v4.11-rc5
Git-commit: e3d5092b6756b9e0b08f94bbeafcc7afe19f0996
References: bsc#1028819

The on-stack resource-window 'win' in setup_res() is not
properly initialized. This causes the pointers in the
embedded 'struct resource' to contain stale pointers.

These pointers (in my case the ->child pointer) gets later
propagated to the global iomem_resources list, causing a #GP
exception when the list is traversed in
iomem_map_sanity_check().

Fixes: c183619b63ec ('x86/irq, ACPI: Implement ACPI driver to support IOAPIC hotplug')
