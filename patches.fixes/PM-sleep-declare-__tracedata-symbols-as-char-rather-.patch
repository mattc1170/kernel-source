Subject: PM / sleep: declare __tracedata symbols as char[] rather than char
Git-commit: f97238373b8662a6d580e204df2e7bcbfa43e27a
Patch-mainline: v4.6-rc1
References: bnc#1005895

Accessing more than one byte from a symbol declared simply 'char' is undefined
behavior, as reported by UBSAN:

	UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in drivers/base/power/trace.c:178:18
	load of address ffffffff8203fc78 with insufficient space
	for an object of type 'char'

Avoid this by declaring the symbols as arrays.
