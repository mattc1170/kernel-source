Subject: scsi: lpfc: Fix oops when NVME Target is discovered in a nonNVME
 environment
Git-commit: bb6a8a2c24f263cdff78b62ada58cecd8c89c03d
Patch-Mainline: v4.14-rc1

lpfc oops when it discovers a NVME target but is configured for SCSI
only operation. Oops is in lpfc_nvme_register_port+0x33/0x300.

The localport is not valid so it should not have been referenced.

Added validity check for localport
