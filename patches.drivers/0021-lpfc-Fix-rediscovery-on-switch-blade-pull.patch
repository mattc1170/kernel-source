Subject: scsi: lpfc: Fix rediscovery on switch blade pull
Git-commit: d2aa48761e4f102b672e9ff1b6c8d26af782b286
Patch-Mainline: v4.14-rc1
References: bsc#1052384

When the switch blade is pulled out then plugged back in, the driver
does not issue a PLOGI to the target

When the switch blade is pulled out, it does not reset the link. The
driver ends up issuing a LOGO to the target, and finally sees devloss.
Since the driver believes that a LOGO is outstanding, it does not issue
a PLOGI to the target upon link up

Correct by placing the ndlp in UNUSED state When devloss happens in
LOGO_ISSUE state.
