Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Force ringbuffers to not be at offset 0
Git-commit: 1b3e885a05d4f0a35dde035724e7c6453d2cbe71
Patch-mainline: 4.6-rc5
References: bsc#1015367

For reasons unknown Sandybridge GT1 (at least) will eventually hang when
it encounters a ring wraparound at offset 0. The test case that
reproduces the bug reliably forces a large number of interrupted context
switches, thereby causing very frequent ring wraparounds, but there are
similar bug reports in the wild with the same symptoms, seqno writes
stop just before the wrap and the ringbuffer at address 0. It is also
timing crucial, but adding various delays hasn't helped pinpoint where
the window lies.

Whether the fault is restricted to the ringbuffer itself or the GTT
addressing is unclear, but moving the ringbuffer fixes all the hangs I
have been able to reproduce.
