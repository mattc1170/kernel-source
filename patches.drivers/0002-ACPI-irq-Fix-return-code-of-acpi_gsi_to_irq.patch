Subject: [PATCH 2/7] ACPI / irq: Fix return code of acpi_gsi_to_irq()

Git-commit: 1dc482b6578e2869e51c35276017178503d5ac81
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
References: bsc#1053627

The function acpi_gsi_to_irq() must return 0 on success as the caller
ghes_probe expects an 0 for success. This change also matches x86
implementation.

This patch was submitted around 4.5 timeframe but wasn't pushed because
it didn't fix a real problem. Now that RAS/GHES patches are in kernel,
this fixes an error seen on a Mustang (arm64) platform:

    GHES: Failed to map GSI to IRQ for generic hardware error source: 2
    GHES: probe of GHES.2 failed with error 81
