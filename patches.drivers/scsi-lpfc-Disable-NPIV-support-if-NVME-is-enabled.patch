Subject: [PATCH] scsi: lpfc: Disable NPIV support if NVME is enabled
References: bsc#1067735
Git-commit: 42270dce9d78acbaa5b9ca4fd4e82d251a8d099b
Patch-Mainline: v4.15

The initial implementation of NVME didn't merge with NPIV support.  As
such, there are several issues if NPIV is used with NVME. For now,
ensure that if NVME is enabled then NPIV is not enabled.

Support for NPIV with NVME will be added in the near future.
