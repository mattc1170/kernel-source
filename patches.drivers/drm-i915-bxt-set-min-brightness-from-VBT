Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915/bxt: set min brightness from VBT
Git-commit: ac73661c6222faef1a97ec44f424234f165e4710
No-Fix: c3881128cb672cf484a52fbb36b5daa9044d9168
Patch-mainline: 4.14-rc2
References: bsc#1031717

Min brightness value from vbt was missing for BXT platform.
This setting have to refer backlight ic spec to restrict
min backlight output. Without this restriction, driver would
allow to configure lower brightness value and violate
backlight ic requirement.
