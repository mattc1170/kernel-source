Subject: [PATCH 07/82] ASoC: rt5640: remove unused variable
Git-commit: c77dd678a7659d58625bd3b3a36d1329d9e7d44c
Patch-mainline: 4.6-rc1
References: bsc#1010690

We are getting build warning about:
sound/soc/codecs/rt5640.c:1892:11: warning: unused variable 'dai_sel'

The use of the variable was removed but the variable itself was not
removed.

Fixes: c467fc0e010b ("ASoC: rt5640: Set PLL src according to source")
