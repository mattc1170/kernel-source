    drm/i915: Wait up to 3ms for the pcu to ack the cdclk change request on SKL

increased the timeout to match the spec, but we still see a timeout on
at least one SKL. A CDCLK change request following the failed one will
succeed nevertheless.

I could reproduce this problem easily by running kms_pipe_crc_basic in a
loop. In all failure cases _wait_for() was pre-empted for >3ms and so in
the worst case - when the pre-emption happened right after calculating
timeout__ in _wait_for() - we called skl_cdclk_wait_for_pcu_ready() only
once which failed and so _wait_for() timed out. As opposed to this the
spec says to keep retrying the request for at most a 3ms period.

To fix this send the first request explicitly to guarantee that there is
3ms between the first and last request. Though this matches the spec, I
noticed that in rare cases this can still time out if we sent only a few
requests (in the worst case 2) _and_ PCODE is busy for some reason even
after a previous request and a 3ms delay. To work around this retry the
polling with pre-emption disabled to maximize the number of requests.
Also increase the timeout to 10ms to account for interrupts that could
reduce the number of requests. With this change I couldn't trigger
the problem.

V2: 
- Use 1ms poll period instead of 10us. (Chris)
V3: 
- Poll with pre-emption disabled to increase the number of request
  attempts. (Ville, Chris)
- Factor out a helper to poll, it's also needed by the next patch.
V4: 
- Pass reply_mask, reply to skl_pcode_request(), instead of assuming the
  reply is generic. (Ville)
V5: 
- List the request specific timeout values as code comment. (Ville)
V6: 
- Try the poll first with preemption enabled.
- Add code comment about first request being queued by PCODE. (Art)
- Add timeout_base_ms argument. (Ville)
V7: 
- Clarify code comment about first queued request. (Chris)
