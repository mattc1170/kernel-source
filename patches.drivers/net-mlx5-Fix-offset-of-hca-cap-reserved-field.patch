Subject: net/mlx5: Fix offset of hca cap reserved field
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
Git-commit: 137ffd15f71ec29ff1a57728081569698591225a
References: bsc#1015342

The offending commit pushed fwd the field by two bits but
didn't increment the offset, fix that. Currently, no damage
was done b/c this is just a field name, but lets have it right.

Fixes: f32f5bd2eb7e ('net/mlx5: Configure cache line size for start and end padding')
