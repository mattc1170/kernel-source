Subject: ACPI: APD: Fix HID for Hisilicon Hip07/08
Git-commit: f7f3dd5b4cbb138ed4559b0d096bab76a8f476de
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc4
References: bsc#1049291

ACPI HID for Hisilicon Hip07/08 should be HISI02A1/2,
not HISI0A21/2, HISI02A1/2 was tested ok but was modified
by the stupid typo when upstream the patches (by me),
correct them to the right IDs (matching the IDs in
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-designware-platdrv.c).

Fixes: 6e14cf361a0c (ACPI / APD: Add clock frequency for Hisilicon Hip07/08 I2C controller)
