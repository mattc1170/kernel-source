Subject: [PATCH] nvme-fc: stop queues on error detection
Git-commit: 2952a879bacbfae8b03fd886754e64fe14b8041e
Patch-Mainline: v4.12-rc2
References: bsc#1037838

Per the recommendation by Sagi on:
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-nvme/2017-April/009261.html

Rather than waiting for reset work thread to stop queues and abort the ios,
immediately stop the queues on error detection. Reset thread will restop
the queues (as it's called on other paths), but it does not appear to have
a side effect.
