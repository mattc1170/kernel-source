Subject: [PATCH] [media] DaVinci-VPFE-Capture: fix error handling
Git-commit: d3d83ee20afda16ad0133ba00f63c11a8d842a35
Patch-mainline: 4.10-rc1
References: bsc#1031717

A recent cleanup had the right idea to remove the initialization
of the error variable, but missed the actual benefit of that,
which is that we get warnings if there is a bug in it. Now
we get a warning about a bug that was introduced by this cleanup:

Drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpfe_capture.c: In function 'vpfe_probe':
drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpfe_capture.c:1992:9: error: 'ret' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This adds the missing initialization that the warning is about,
and another one that was preexisting and that we did not get
a warning for. That second bug has existed since the driver
was first added.

Fixes: efb74461f5a6 ("[media] DaVinci-VPFE-Capture: Delete an unnecessary variable initialisation in vpfe_probe()")
Fixes: 7da8a6cb3e5b ("V4L/DVB (12248): v4l: vpfe capture bridge driver for DM355 and DM6446")
