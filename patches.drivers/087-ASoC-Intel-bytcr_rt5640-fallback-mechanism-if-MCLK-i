Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: fallback mechanism if MCLK is not
 enabled
Patch-mainline: Submitted, alsa-devel ML, Dec 13, 2016
References: bsc#1010690

Commit df1a2776a795 ("ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: add MCLK support")
was merged but the corresponding clock framework patches have not,
after being bumped from audio to clock to x86 domains. The missing
clock-related patches result in a regression starting with 4.9 with
the audio card not being created.

Rather than reverting this commit and all following updates already
queued up for 4.10, handle run-time dependency on MCLK and fall back
to the previous bit-clock mode. This provides the same functionality
as in 4.8 for Baytrail devices. On Baytrail-CR most devices remain
silent with this fallback but additional patches are needed anyway.

This patch should be applied to -stable as well as ASoC 4.10 fixes
