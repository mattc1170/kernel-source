Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda - Turn off loopback mixing as default
Git-commit: fabc16fe9a92709c284325fbd14805fa410dc1d3
Patch-mainline: 4.8-rc1
References: bsc#1001462

So far, we enabled the loopback mixing control as default, as this
behavior made somewhat compatible with the earlier HD-audio drivers
for Realtek & co.  However, it's getting annoying as we've got more
and more bug reports about the noise coming from the loopback route.
Since the loopback mixing is used fairly rarely and often harmful
(e.g. using PA), let's get rid of the default turn-on lines.
