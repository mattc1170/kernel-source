Subject: [PATCH] clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Fix mem frame loop
 initialization

Git-commit: d197f7988721221fac64f899efd7657c15281810
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc6
References: bsc#1055709

The loop to find the best memory frame in arch_timer_mem_acpi_init()
initializes the loop counter with itself ('i = i'), which is suspicious
in the first place and pointed out by clang. The loop condition is
'i < timer_count' and a prior for loop exits when 'i' reaches
'timer_count', therefore the second loop is never executed.

Initialize the loop counter with 0 to iterate over all timers, which
supposedly was the intention before the typo monster attacked.
