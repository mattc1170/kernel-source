Subject: [PATCH 03/12] ARM: bcm2835: Add a group for mapping pins 48-53 to
 sdhost.

Patch-mainline: v4.10-rc1
Git-commit: 21ff843931b2e5a9b628ac56fd0f2e4355890096 (partial)
References: bsc#983145

This pin group definition comes from downstream.  We don't have a
driver for sdhost integrated yet, but they've been experimenting with
it and it sounds useful to bring over.
