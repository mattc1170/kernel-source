Subject: [PATCH] drm/i915: Call intel_dp_mst_resume() before resuming displays
Git-commit: 1e8817b7f603464369b3f70895946254bf62ba8e
Patch-mainline: 4.6-rc4
References: bsc#1015359
No-Fix: a16b7658f4e0d4aec9bc3e75a5f0cc3f7a3a0422

Since we need MST devices ready before we try to resume displays,
calling this after intel_display_resume() can result in some issues with
various laptop docks where the monitor won't turn back on after
suspending the system.

This order was originally changed in

	commit e7d6f7d70829 ("drm/i915: resume MST after reading back hw state")

In order to fix some unclaimed register errors, however the actual cause
of those has since been fixed.
