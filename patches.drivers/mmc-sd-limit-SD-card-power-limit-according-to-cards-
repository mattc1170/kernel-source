Subject: [PATCH] mmc: sd: limit SD card power limit according to cards capabilities
Git-commit: d9812780a020bcec44565b5950b2a8b31afb5545
Patch-mainline: 4.5-rc1
References: bsc#1031717

The SD card specification allows cards to error out a SWITCH command
where the requested function in a group is not supported.  The spec
provides for a set of capabilities which indicate which functions are
supported.

In the case of the power limit, requesting an unsupported power level
via the SWITCH command fails, resulting in the power level remaining at
the power-on default of 0.72W, even though the host and card may support
higher powers levels.

This has been seen with SanDisk 8GB cards, which support the default
0.72W and 1.44W (200mA and 400mA) in combination with an iMX6 host,
supporting up to 2.88W (800mA).  This currently causes us to try to set
a power limit function value of '3' (2.88W) which the card errors out
on, and thereby causes the power level to remain at 0.72W rather than
the desired 1.44W.

Arrange to limit the selected current limit by the capabilities reported
by the card to avoid the SWITCH command failing.  Select the highest
current limit that the host and card combination support.
