Subject: [PATCH] ARC: Re-enable MMU upon Machine Check exception
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.89
Git-commit: 1ee55a8f7f6b7ca4c0c59e0b4b4e3584a085c2d3

commit 1ee55a8f7f6b7ca4c0c59e0b4b4e3584a085c2d3 upstream.

I recently came upon a scenario where I would get a double fault
machine check exception tiriggered by a kernel module.
However the ensuing crash stacktrace (ksym lookup) was not working
correctly.

Turns out that machine check auto-disables MMU while modules are allocated
in kernel vaddr spapce.

This patch re-enables the MMU before start printing the stacktrace
making stacktracing of modules work upon a fatal exception.
