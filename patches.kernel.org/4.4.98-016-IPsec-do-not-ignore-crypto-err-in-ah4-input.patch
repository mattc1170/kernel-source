Subject: [PATCH] IPsec: do not ignore crypto err in ah4 input
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.98
Git-commit: ebd89a2d0675f1325c2be5b7576fd8cb7e8defd0

[ Upstream commit ebd89a2d0675f1325c2be5b7576fd8cb7e8defd0 ]

ah4 input processing uses the asynchronous hash crypto API which
supplies an error code as part of the operation completion but
the error code was being ignored.

Treat a crypto API error indication as a verification failure.

While a crypto API reported error would almost certainly result
in a memcpy of the digest failing anyway and thus the security
risk seems minor, performing a memory compare on what might be
uninitialized memory is wrong.
