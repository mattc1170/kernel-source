Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix data corruption for mmap writes
Patch-mainline: 4.4.92
References: bnc#1012382 bsc#1012829
Git-commit: a056bdaae7a181f7dcc876cfab2f94538e508709

commit a056bdaae7a181f7dcc876cfab2f94538e508709 upstream.

mpage_submit_page() can race with another process growing i_size and
writing data via mmap to the written-back page. As mpage_submit_page()
samples i_size too early, it may happen that ext4_bio_write_page()
zeroes out too large tail of the page and thus corrupts user data.

Fix the problem by sampling i_size only after the page has been
write-protected in page tables by clear_page_dirty_for_io() call.
