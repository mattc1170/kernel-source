Subject: [PATCH] NFC: fix device-allocation error return
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.103
Git-commit: c45e3e4c5b134b081e8af362109905427967eb19

commit c45e3e4c5b134b081e8af362109905427967eb19 upstream.

A recent change fixing NFC device allocation itself introduced an
error-handling bug by returning an error pointer in case device-id
allocation failed. This is clearly broken as the callers still expected
NULL to be returned on errors as detected by Dan's static checker.

Fix this up by returning NULL in the event that we've run out of memory
when allocating a new device id.

Note that the offending commit is marked for stable (3.8) so this fix
needs to be backported along with it.
