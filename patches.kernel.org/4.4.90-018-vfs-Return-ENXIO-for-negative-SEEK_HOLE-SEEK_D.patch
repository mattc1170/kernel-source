Subject: [PATCH] vfs: Return -ENXIO for negative SEEK_HOLE / SEEK_DATA offsets
References: bnc#1012382
Patch-mainline: 4.4.90
Git-commit: fc46820b27a2d9a46f7e90c9ceb4a64a1bc5fab8

commit fc46820b27a2d9a46f7e90c9ceb4a64a1bc5fab8 upstream.

In generic_file_llseek_size, return -ENXIO for negative offsets as well
as offsets beyond EOF.  This affects filesystems which don't implement
SEEK_HOLE / SEEK_DATA internally, possibly because they don't support
holes.

Fixes xfstest generic/448.
