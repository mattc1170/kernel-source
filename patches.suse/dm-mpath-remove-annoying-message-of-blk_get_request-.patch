Subject: [PATCH] dm mpath: remove annoying message of 'blk_get_request()
 returned -11'
Git-commit: 9dc112e2daf87b40607fd8d357e2d7de32290d45
Patch-mainline: v4.15-rc1
References: bsc#1066812

It is very normal to see allocation failure, especially with blk-mq
request_queues, so it's unnecessary to report this error and annoy
people.

In practice this 'blk_get_request() returned -11' error gets logged
quite frequently when a blk-mq DM multipath device sees heavy IO.

This change is marked for stable@ because the annoying message in
question was included in stable@ commit 7083abbbf.

Fixes: 7083abbbf ("dm mpath: avoid that path removal can trigger an infinite loop")
