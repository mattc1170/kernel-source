Subject: tpm: Downgrade error level
Patch-mainline: Never, SLE12-SP2/3 only
References: bsc#1042535

An error message like below is a common pattern found on many laptops
and actually it's a harmless notification:
  tpm_tis 00:09: A TPM error (6) occurred attempting to read a pcr value

For a better mental health of users, let's downgrade the kernel error
level for this message.
