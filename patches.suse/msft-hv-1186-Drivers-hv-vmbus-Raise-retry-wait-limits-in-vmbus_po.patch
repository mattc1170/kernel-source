Subject: Drivers: hv: vmbus: Raise retry/wait limits in vmbus_post_msg()
Git-commit: c0bb03924f1a80e7f65900e36c8e6b3dc167c5f8
References: fate#320485, bsc#1023287, bsc#1028217

DoS protection conditions were altered in WS2016 and now it's easy to get
-EAGAIN returned from vmbus_post_msg() (e.g. when we try changing MTU on a
netvsc device in a loop). All vmbus_post_msg() callers don't retry the
operation and we usually end up with a non-functional device or crash.

While host's DoS protection conditions are unknown to me my tests show that
it can take up to 10 seconds before the message is sent so doing udelay()
is not an option, we really need to sleep. Almost all vmbus_post_msg()
callers are ready to sleep but there is one special case:
vmbus_initiate_unload() which can be called from interrupt/NMI context and
we can't sleep there. I'm also not sure about the lonely
vmbus_send_tl_connect_request() which has no in-tree users but its external
users are most likely waiting for the host to reply so sleeping there is
also appropriate.
