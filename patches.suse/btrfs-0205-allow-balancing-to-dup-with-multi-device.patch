Subject: [PATCH] btrfs: allow balancing to dup with multi-device

Currently, we don't allow the user to try and rebalance to a dup profile
on a multi-device filesystem.  In most cases, this is a perfectly sensible
restriction as raid1 uses the same amount of space and provides better
protection.

However, when reshaping a multi-device filesystem down to a single device
filesystem, this requires the user to convert metadata and system chunks
to single profile before deleting devices, and then convert again to dup,
which leaves a period of time where metadata integrity is reduced.

This patch removes the single-device-only restriction from converting to
dup profile to remove this potential data integrity reduction.
