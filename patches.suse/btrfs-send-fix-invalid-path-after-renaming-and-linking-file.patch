Subject: [PATCH 1/3] Btrfs: send, fix invalid path after renaming and linking
 file
Git-commit: 72c3668fed2b3eec7c6fc059e7b54855361e3011
Patch-mainline: v4.13-rc1
References: bsc#1051479

Currently an incremental snapshot can generate link operations which
contain an invalid target path. Such case happens when in the send
snapshot a file was renamed, a new hard link added for it and some
other inode (with a lower number) got renamed to the former name of
that file. Example:

Parent snapshot

 .                  (ino 256)
 |
 |--- f1            (ino 257)
 |--- f2            (ino 258)
 |--- f3            (ino 259)

Send snapshot

 .                  (ino 256)
 |
 |--- f2            (ino 257)
 |--- f3            (ino 258)
 |--- f4            (ino 259)
 |--- f5            (ino 258)

The following steps happen when computing the incremental send stream:

1) When processing inode 257, inode 258 is orphanized (renamed to
   "o258-7-0"), because its current reference has the same name as the
   new reference for inode 257;

2) When processing inode 258, we iterate over all its new references,
   which have the names "f3" and "f5". The first iteration sees name
   "f5" and renames the inode from its orphan name ("o258-7-0") to
   "f5", while the second iteration sees the name "f3" and, incorrectly,
   issues a link operation with a target name matching the orphan name,
   which no longer exists. The first iteration had reset the current
   valid path of the inode to "f5", but in the second iteration we lost
   it because we found another inode, with a higher number of 259, which
   has a reference named "f3" as well, so we orphanized inode 259 and
   recomputed the current valid path of inode 258 to its old orphan
   name because inode 259 could be an ancestor of inode 258 and therefore
   the current valid path could contain the pre-orphanization name of
   inode 259. However in this case inode 259 is not an ancestor of inode
   258 so the current valid path should not be recomputed.
   This makes the receiver fail with the following error:

   ERROR: link f3 -> o258-7-0 failed: No such file or directory

So fix this by not recomputing the current valid path for an inode
whenever we find a colliding reference from some not yet processed inode
(inode number higher then the one currently being processed), unless
that other inode is an ancestor of the one we are currently processing.

A test case for fstests will follow soon.
